A collection of simple image processing utilities using basic convolution
matrices.

Prerequisites
-------------

Python 3.4 or higher is required.
Additionally, [OpenCV]'s Python bindings are used for image manipulation.
Please note that [NumPy] is also required as a transitive dependency.
The versions below have been verified to work properly.

| Software      | Version |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Python        | 3.5.1   |
| numpy         | 1.11.0  |
| opencv-python | 3.1.0   |

[NumPy]: http://www.numpy.org/
[OpenCV]: http://opencv.org/

Windows binaries of the required packages for CPython can be acquired at the
usual place: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/.
Please note that OpenCV's Python bindings require [Visual C++ Redistributable
for Visual Studio 2015] to be installed on Windows.
